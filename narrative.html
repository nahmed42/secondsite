	<h3>Who is Nihad? </h3>
	I’m Nihad Ahmed, a passionate English graduate student and a third grade teacher. 
	<h4>What do I aim for? </h4>
	I aim to inspire others with the beauty of language! Nature and spending time
	 outdoors also bring me peace and creativity.
	 <h5>What is joy to me? </h5>
	 Traveling brings me the greatest joy and always keeps me grounded.
	  I have lived in 7 countries before I moved to the states at the age of 11 
	  and lived in Virginia ever since.
